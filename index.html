        Hi, I'm <strong>Neha Joshi</strong>, a Computer Engineering student who enjoys learning and creating things through code. 
        I'm passionate about DSA, solving problems, and continuously improving myself at my own pace without comparing with others.
    </p>

    <p>
        Alongside academics, I'm also an active cadet in the <strong>National Cadet Corps (NCC)</strong>, Army Wing. 
        NCC has helped me stay disciplined, responsible, and grounded. I've learned the importance of consistency, teamwork, and staying calm under pressure.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm someone who believes in doing things sincerely, even if theyâ€™re small, and I value personal growth more than show.
        Right now, I'm focused on learning, becoming better each day, and building a future I can be proud of.
